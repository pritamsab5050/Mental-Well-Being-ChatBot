              "        The feeling of worthlessness can be caused by a variety of factors, including internal comparisons to others and the belief that you need to be someone other than who you are. It's important to remember that no one is worthless and that you have inherent value. One way to start changing these feelings is to focus on finding your worth and not letting negative thoughts talk you out of the good you find in yourself. This can be as simple as recognizing and appreciating small accomplishments, such as getting out of bed and making a phone call or a joke. It's also important to be kind to yourself and not let setbacks, like a disagreement with your boss, define your self-worth. It may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional to work through these feelings and develop strategies for building a more positive self-image.\n",
